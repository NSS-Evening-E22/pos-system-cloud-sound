Hip-Hop Pizza and Wangs is a website made for a locally-owned pizza and wings restaurant. It is built to be the server’s point-of-sale system used to enter and keep track of sales, orders, and revenue.

## Ideal User
* The ideal user for this application is a server or owner at Hip-Hop Pizza and Wangs
* They need to keep track of things like how their orders come in (by phone or walk-in) and how much they’re earning in revenue and tips.
* This solves the problem of having to manually track these metrics. It allows servers to focus on enthusiastically serving guests instead of focusing on writing down, keeping track of and organizing orders. 


## Features
* When a new order is added, it is added into our database and displayed on the DOM on our View Orders page.
* **Adding items**: Once an order is added, the user can go into the order to add items. In the add items screen, the user can add the item and the item total.
* **View Revenue**: This page adds up the total cost of all orders in the database and displays the total. It also displays the total amount of all tips added to orders, the number of called in vs walk-in orders, and the number of cash vs card payments.
* **Editing Items and Orders**: On already created items or orders, the user can use the edit button to go back and change any information that was originally added.
